====== Operators ======

XC=BASIC provides the following operators:

===== Arithmetic Operators =====

  * ''*'' (multiplication)
  * ''/'' (division)
  * ''MOD'' (modulo)
  * ''+'' (addition or string concatenation)
  * ''-'' (subtraction)

Operands for the arithmetic operators can be any numeric expressions, with the exception of ''DECIMAL'' types that can only be operands for addition or subtraction.

The ''+'' operator can also be used to concatenate strings. In this case both operands must be strings, otherwise a compile-time error is emitted.

===== Relational Operators =====

  * ''='' (equal to)
  * ''<>'' (not equal to)
  * ''>'' (greater than)
  * ''>='' (greater than or equal to)
  * ''<'' (less than)
  * ''<='' (less than or equal to)

Operands for the relational operators can be any numeric expressions. A relational expression evaluates to ''255'' when the comparison passes (TRUE), and ''0'' when it fails (FALSE).

The relational operators ''='' and ''<>'' can also be used to compare strings. In this case both operands must be strings, otherwise a compile-time error will be emitted.

<adm note>
Comparing strings for ''>'', ''>='', ''<'' and ''<='' is not supported.

===== Logical Operators =====

  * ''AND''
  * ''OR''
  * ''XOR''
  * [[SHL]] - logical shift left
  * [[SHR]] - logical shift right

Logical operators can operate on all integral types (BYTE, INT, WORD, LONG and DECIMAL).

===== Unary Operators =====

  * ''@'' ([[address-of|address of]])
  * ''-'' (negation)
  * ''NOT'' (logical reversion)
