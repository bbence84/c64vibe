# VibeC64 - AI-Powered Commodore 64 Game Creator

Welcome to **VibeC64**, your AI assistant for creating Commodore 64 BASIC V2.0 games!

## What VibeC64 Can Do

VibeC64 is an intelligent AI agent that helps you bring your retro gaming ideas to life. It can:

- 🎨 **Design Games** - Transform your game ideas into detailed design plans with storylines, characters, locations, and gameplay mechanics
- 💻 **Write C64 BASIC V2.0 Code** - Generate syntactically correct BASIC programs that run on real Commodore 64 hardware
- 🔍 **Check & Fix Syntax** - Automatically validate your code and fix any syntax errors
- 💾 **Export Programs** - Download your creations as .BAS and .PRG files
- 🎮 **Launch Game in C64 Emulator** - Alternatively, open the created program directly in an online [C64 emulator](https://ty64.krissz.hu/)
- 🎯 **Run on Real Hardware** - Load and execute programs on actual C64 hardware via KungFu Flash (when connected, not available in the online version, only in locally hosted one). Commodore 64 Ultimate support coming soon!

## How to Use VibeC64

Getting started is simple - just describe what you want to create in plain English!

### Example Requests

- *"Make a text adventure game set in a haunted castle"*
- *"Create a simple space shooter game where the player shoots asteroids"*
- *"Generate a maze game with collectible items"*
- *"A snake game where you have to catch a flashing heart"*

### The Agent Will

1. **Design** - Create a detailed game plan based on your description
2. **Code** - Generate complete C64 BASIC V2.0 source code
3. **Validate** - Check for syntax errors and fix them automatically
4. **Test** - Optionally run the game on real hardware (if connected)
5. **Deliver** - Provide downloadable .BAS and .PRG files, open it in an emulator

### Troubleshooting a Generated Program

If you are still in the same session that generated the original game, you only need to describe the error to the AI agent and it will try to fix the issue. Additionally, you can also upload a screenshot which the agent will process and use for troubleshooting. It's sometimes sufficient to attach just the screenshot (or photo) showing the error.

If you are in a new session and you still have the original BAS source code file, you can upload that in a new session and ask the AI agent to troubleshoot it.

### Hardware Support

VibeC64 works with or without physical hardware:

- ✅ **Software Only** - Generate and download C64 programs to run in an emulator
- ✅ **With Hardware** - Connect KungFu Flash, C64 keyboard, and capture device for full hardware integration. Commodore 64 Ultimate support coming soon!

### Getting an AI Model Provider API Key

In order to use this app, you need to register an AI model provider account through either OpenRouter or directly with the vendor. OpenRouter allows you to use multiple AI models from different providers with a single API key. 

[Get an API key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) after registration and [adding credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits). You can also get API keys directly, i.e. in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys). There's free quota, but it's pretty limited, so you also need to enable billing. 

For best experience and cost efficiency, we recommend using the **Google Gemini 3.0 Flash Preview model**.
