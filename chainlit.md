### Getting an AI Model Provider API Key

In order to use this app, you need to register an AI model provider account through either OpenRouter or directly with the vendor. OpenRouter allows you to use multiple AI models from different providers with a single API key. 

[Get an API key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) after registration and [adding credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits). You can also get API keys directly, i.e. in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys). There's free quota, but it's pretty limited, so you also need to enable billing. 

For best experience and cost efficiency, we recommend using the **Google Gemini 3.0 Flash Preview model**.
